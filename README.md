# Timeseries test-app with ZIO and Scala 3

Test app that shows a possible implementation of a service that
reads time series data.

__Note__:
This implementation differs from the original one in that here was used ZIO 2 with Scala 3.
Some pieces can look uglier since some of the libraries haven't been published for Scala 3 yet. 

The app overview could be found here: [time series app architecture](https://github.com/VladPodilnyk/timeseries-test-app).
